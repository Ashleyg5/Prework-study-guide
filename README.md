# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created this prework study guide webpage to assist myself and other bootcamp students struggling to find all prework information in one place. The prework for the course taught the basic structure needed for coders to understand HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This guide serves as a resource for all bootcamp students to look back at any point during the course for a refresher on the basics of web development.

This prework study guide contains helpful information, codes, and tips for web developers. There are 4 separate sections, each containing information prudent to the topic. The sections listed are HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. 

When looking at the live application, using DevTools, users will see the JavaScript code in use. The console will include the topics learned during prework and a randomly selected topic to study.
